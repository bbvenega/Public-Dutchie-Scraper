# Description: This program is used to fetch the inventory data from the Dutchie Backoffice and write it to a Google Sheet
# This program is currently configured to fetch very specific data (such as the product name, package ID, available quantity, inventory date, unit price, batch, THC percentage, and room) from the Dutchie Backoffice
# In order to change the data that is fetched, you will need to modify the code in the fetch_Inventories function and ensure that your account has those values present in the Dutchie Backoffice inventory table in the proper order
